### 5. **React Hooks**
   - **Goal:** Enhance React applications using hooks.
   - **Topics Covered:**
     - `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and custom hooks.
     - Advanced hooks (`useReducer`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`).
   - **Mini Project:** Build a movie search app that uses Axios to fetch movie data from an API and `useEffect` to handle API calls.

     - Data fetching methods (`getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`).
   - **Mini Project:** Build a blog using Next.js that fetches posts from an API, supports dynamic routing, and uses static generation.

---

### 8. **Final Project**
   - **Goal:** Combine everything learned into a full-fledged application.
   - **Project Idea:** Build a portfolio website or an e-commerce store with product listing, detail pages, and a contact form. Use:
     - **React.js** for building the user interface.
